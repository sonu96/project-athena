"""
Integration tests for Athena DeFi Agent component interactions

Tests how components work together:
- Treasury + Memory: Cost deduction triggering survival memories
- Market Detection + Workflows: Market analysis flowing into decisions
- Agent Orchestration: Full observation cycles with all components
- Memory Context: How memories influence decision making
- Cost Optimization: Cross-component cost management

Uses mocked external services but real component interactions.
