"""
Unit tests for individual Athena DeFi Agent components

Tests isolated functionality of core components:
- TreasuryManager: Balance tracking, emotional states, survival mechanisms
- MemoryManager: Memory formation, retrieval, pattern detection
- MarketDetector: Market condition detection, confidence scoring
- LangGraph Workflows: Market analysis and decision workflows
- Agent: Core agent initialization and configuration

Each test uses mocks for external dependencies to ensure isolation.
