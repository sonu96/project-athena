# Enhanced LangGraph Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the sophisticated LangGraph architecture for Athena's trading agent, where LLM functionality is deeply integrated within the graph structure itself, enabling dynamic routing, parallel processing, and adaptive behavior.

## Core Innovations

### 1. Integrated LLM Nodes
Instead of calling LLMs from within nodes, the LLMs are part of the graph's routing and decision logic:

```python
# Traditional approach (what we're replacing)
async def think_node(state):
    llm = get_llm()
    response = await llm.call(prompt)
    return state

# Enhanced approach (integrated LLM)
@traceable(name="llm_think")
async def llm_enhanced_think(state: EnhancedConsciousnessState):
    # Dynamic model selection based on state
    complexity = analyze_complexity(state)
    llm, model_key = llm_router.select_model(state, complexity)
    
    # LLM is part of the node's core logic
    response = await llm.ainvoke(messages)
    
    # Cost-aware processing
    state.total_llm_cost += calculate_cost(response, model_key)
    return state
```

### 2. Dynamic Model Selection

The `LLMRouter` class intelligently selects models based on:
- **Treasury Balance**: Use cheaper models when funds are low
- **Emotional State**: Conservative models in desperate mode
- **Task Complexity**: Match model power to task requirements

```python
Model Tiers:
- Critical: Claude Haiku ($0.25/1M tokens) - Survival mode
- Efficient: GPT-3.5 ($0.50/1M tokens) - Routine tasks  
- Balanced: Claude Sonnet ($3/1M tokens) - Complex analysis
- Powerful: Claude Opus ($15/1M tokens) - Critical decisions
```

### 3. Parallel Processing Architecture

Multiple operations can run simultaneously:

```python
# Parallel sensing of multiple data sources
results = await asyncio.gather(
    sense_market(),      # Market data
    sense_wallet(),      # Wallet state
    sense_memories()     # Memory patterns
)

# Parallel decision making
decisions = await asyncio.gather(*[
    make_decision(dtype, complexity) 
    for dtype, complexity in decisions_needed
])
```

### 4. Multi-Agent System

Specialized sub-agents collaborate on complex tasks:

```python
Specialist Agents:
1. Market Analyst - Deep market analysis and pattern recognition
2. Risk Manager - Position risk assessment and liquidation prevention
3. Strategy Optimizer - Parameter tuning and strategy improvement
4. Memory Curator - Pattern extraction and memory organization
```

### 5. Adaptive Routing

The graph can dynamically change its flow based on state:

```python
def route_after_sense(state) -> List[str]:
    routes = ["think"]  # Always analyze
    
    if state.market_data.get("volume_24h") > 1B:
        routes.append("deep_analysis")  # Add intensive analysis
    
    if state.treasury_balance < 50:
        routes.append("emergency_check")  # Survival mode
    
    return routes
```

## State Management

### Enhanced Consciousness State

The new state structure includes:

```python
class EnhancedConsciousnessState(BaseModel):
    # Core identity
    agent_id: str
    timestamp: datetime
    
    # Treasury & survival
    treasury_balance: float
    daily_burn_rate: float
    days_until_bankruptcy: float
    
    # Emotional intelligence
    emotional_state: Literal["desperate", "cautious", "stable", "confident"]
    emotional_intensity: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
    confidence_level: float
    
    # Market perception
    market_data: Dict[str, Any]
    active_patterns: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    
    # Memory & learning
    relevant_memories: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    learned_concepts: Dict[str, Any]
    
    # LLM integration
    messages: List[BaseMessage]  # Conversation history
    llm_model: str  # Current model selection
    total_llm_cost: float  # Cost tracking
    
    # Workflow control
    parallel_tasks: List[str]  # Tasks running in parallel
    errors: List[str]
    warnings: List[str]
```

## Workflow Patterns

### 1. Basic Cognitive Loop
```
START → Sense → Think → Feel → Decide → Learn → END
```

### 2. Parallel Processing Flow
```
        ┌→ Market Analysis ─┐
START → Sense →│ Risk Assessment  │→ Synthesize → Decide → Learn → END
        └→ Memory Search  ─┘
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Collaboration
```
                ┌→ Market Analyst ─┐
START → Sense → Coordinate →│ Risk Manager    │→ Consensus → Execute → Learn
                └→ Strategy Opt  ─┘
```

### 4. Adaptive Flow with Conditions
```
START → Sense → Route? →│ Normal: Think → Decide
                       │ Volatile: Deep Analysis → Cautious Decide
                       └ Critical: Emergency → Survival Mode
```

## Memory Integration

### Memory-Augmented Decisions

```python
async def memory_enhanced_decision(state):
    # Query relevant memories
    similar_situations = await memory.search(
        f"market:{state.market_condition} treasury:{state.emotional_state}"
    )
    
    # Weight memories by recency and success
    weighted_memories = weight_by_performance(similar_situations)
    
    # LLM uses memories for decision
    prompt = f"""
    Current situation: {state.market_condition}
    
    Similar past experiences:
    {format_memories(weighted_memories)}
    
    What action maximizes survival and profit?
    """
```

### Learning Patterns

```python
Pattern Categories:
1. Market Patterns: "High volume weekends profitable"
2. Risk Patterns: "Liquidation cascades follow ETH 15% drops"
3. Timing Patterns: "Gas cheapest Sunday 2-6AM UTC"
4. Strategy Patterns: "1.8x leverage optimal for ETH/USDC"
```

## Cost Optimization

### Intelligent Resource Usage

```python
Cost Optimization Rules:
1. Desperate Mode (<$25):
   - Use only Haiku/GPT-3.5
   - Max 256 tokens per response
   - Skip non-critical analysis

2. Cautious Mode ($25-50):
   - Primarily efficient models
   - Sonnet for important decisions
   - 512 token responses

3. Stable Mode ($50-100):
   - Balanced model usage
   - Can use Opus for complex analysis
   - Normal token limits

4. Confident Mode (>$100):
   - Full model access
   - Detailed analysis allowed
   - Focus on maximizing returns
```
