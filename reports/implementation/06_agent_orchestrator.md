- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Price movements, sentiment, volatility, trend strength
- **Confidence Scoring**: Dynamic confidence based on supporting factors
- **Historical Context**: Pattern recognition using recent conditions
- **Risk Assessment**: Market risk levels (low/medium/high)

**Advanced Features**:
- Volatility calculation using historical data
- Trend strength analysis

- **LangGraph Workflows**: Market analysis and decision-making workflows
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Frequency adjustments based on emotional state
- **Survival Mechanisms**: Automatic emergency mode activation
- **Memory Formation**: Experience processing and pattern detection

**Operational Features**:
- Configurable observation intervals
- Cost tracking for every operation
- Graceful error handling and recovery
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Technical Architecture

### Agent Lifecycle
```python
1. Initialize() → Load all components, databases, APIs
2. Start_operations() → Begin main observation loop
3. Observation_cycle() → Collect data → Analyze → Decide → Implement
4. Update_learning() → Consolidate memories and patterns
5. Check_survival() → Monitor treasury and activate emergency mode
6. Shutdown() → Graceful cleanup and final reporting
```

### Decision Flow
```python
Market Data Collection → Condition Detection → Treasury Check → 
Memory Retrieval → LLM Analysis → Decision Making → Implementation
```

### Cost Management Integration
Every operation tracks costs:
- Market data collection: $0.02
- LLM analysis: $0.01-0.08 (model dependent)
- Decision making: $0.02-0.15 (complexity dependent)
- Total per cycle: $0.05-0.25

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Adaptive Observation Frequency
```python
# Emergency mode
if emotional_state == "desperate":
    observation_interval = 7200  # 2 hours (cost reduction)

# Confident mode  
elif emotional_state == "confident":
    observation_interval = 1800  # 30 minutes (increased monitoring)
```

### 2. Market Intelligence Pipeline
```python
# Parallel data collection
tasks = [
    collect_coingecko_data(),
    collect_fear_greed_data(),
    collect_defillama_data()
]
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

### 3. Survival Response System
```python
# Automatic survival mode
if treasury_balance < $25:
    await activate_survival_mode()
    # Reduce all costs, minimize operations
    # Switch to emergency decision making
```

### 4. Memory-Driven Decisions
```python
# Context-aware decision making
memories = await get_relevant_memories({
    "treasury_state": treasury_status,
    "market_condition": condition,
    "emotional_state": emotional_state
})

decision = await llm_workflows.make_decision(
    context=decision_context,
    memories=memories
)
```
