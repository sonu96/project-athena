## 🧠 Core Components Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Consciousness State
```python
class ConsciousnessState:
    agent_id: str
    treasury_balance: float
    emotional_state: EmotionalState
    observed_pools: List[PoolObservation]
    recent_memories: List[Memory]
    active_patterns: List[Pattern]
    # ... 20+ fields tracking complete mental state
```

### 2. Emotional Intelligence System
```python
Emotional States:
- DESPERATE (<7 days): Survival mode, 4h observation cycles
- CAUTIOUS (<20 days): Conservative, 2h cycles  
- STABLE (<90 days): Balanced, 1h cycles
- CONFIDENT (>90 days): Growth mode, 30min cycles

Each state affects:
- LLM model selection (cost optimization)
- Observation frequency
- Memory formation threshold
- Risk tolerance (V2)
```

### 3. LangGraph Cognitive Loop
```
START → Sense → Think → Feel → Decide → Learn → END
         ↑                                        ↓
         └────────────(next cycle)────────────────┘

Parallel Sensing:
- Market data (Aerodrome pools)
- Wallet balance (CDP)
- Gas prices (network)
- Memories (Mem0)
```

### 4. Dynamic LLM Router
```python
Model Selection by Treasury:
- Desperate: Claude Haiku ($0.25/1M tokens)
- Cautious: GPT-3.5 ($0.50/1M tokens)
- Stable: Claude Sonnet ($3/1M tokens)
- Confident: Claude Opus ($15/1M tokens)
```

### 5. Memory System
```python
Categories:
- market_patterns: "USDC/ETH volume spikes on weekends"
- gas_patterns: "Gas cheapest 2-4 AM UTC Sundays"
- pool_behavior: "High APR pools often have high IL"
- timing_patterns: "US market open brings volatility"
- risk_patterns: "Leverage >2x risky in volatile markets"
- survival_memories: "[SURVIVAL] Nearly bankrupt at $5.23"
```
