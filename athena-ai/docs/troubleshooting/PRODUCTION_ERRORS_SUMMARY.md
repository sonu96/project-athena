# Production Errors Summary

## Deployment Status
- **Service URL**: https://athena-ai-6do7ak7bnq-uc.a.run.app
- **Health Check**: ✅ Healthy
- **Agent Active**: ✅ Yes
- **Wallet Address**: 0x56073E79e8d40c05B9a6C775080A659f0654a6d0

## Critical Errors Found

### 1. Event Monitor Initialization Error
```
ERROR - RPC reader or session not initialized
```
- **Impact**: No volume data collection
- **Result**: All pools show $0 volume
- **Consequence**: Fee APR calculations = 0%

### 2. RPC Reader Session Errors
```
ERROR - Failed to call contract function: Session is closed
ERROR - Failed to call contract function: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer
```
- **Impact**: Gauge reader cannot fetch emission data
- **Result**: All emission APRs = 0%
- **Root Cause**: RPC session not properly maintained in async context

### 3. Contract Execution Errors
```
ERROR - RPC error: {'code': 3, 'message': 'execution reverted', 'data': None}
```
- **Impact**: Some contract calls failing
- **Possible Cause**: Incorrect contract addresses or ABI mismatch

## Data Collection Status

### Working ✅
- Price fetching (WETH: ~$3717, AERO: ~$1.13)
- Pool scanning and basic info collection
- Pool profile creation in Firestore
- Price caching implementation

### Not Working ❌
- Volume data collection (Event Monitor)
- Gauge emission data (Gauge Reader)
- APR calculations (all showing 0%)
- Memory storage (no pools meet thresholds)

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue is with the RPC reader session management:
1. Event monitor creates RPC reader but doesn't maintain session
2. Gauge reader's RPC session closes during async operations
3. Without volume and emissions data, APR = 0%
4. Pools with 0% APR don't meet the 20% threshold for memory storage

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Fix RPC Session Management**:
   - Ensure RPC reader uses context manager properly
   - Maintain session throughout the scanning cycle
   - Handle reconnection on session close

2. **Fix Event Monitor Initialization**:
   - Initialize RPC reader before creating event monitor
   - Ensure event monitor has access to active session

3. **Add Error Recovery**:
   - Implement retry logic for RPC calls
   - Add session reconnection on failure
   - Log more detailed error information

4. **Lower Thresholds Temporarily**:
   - Consider lowering APR threshold to capture more data
   - Or add alternative criteria for pool storage

## Next Steps
1. Fix RPC session management in pool scanner
2. Ensure event monitor and gauge reader share same RPC session
3. Add proper error handling and retry logic
4. Monitor logs after fix to verify data collection
