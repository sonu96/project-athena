# Athena AI Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

Athena AI is a 24/7 autonomous DeFi agent that operates on the Base blockchain, specifically focused on the Aerodrome protocol. Unlike traditional trading bots, Athena learns from her experiences, develops theories about market behavior, and continuously improves her strategies.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **LangGraph Agent (Brain)**
   - State machine with OBSERVE → ANALYZE → DECIDE → EXECUTE → LEARN cycle
   - Observation mode: 3-day pattern learning before trading
   - Emotional modeling for decision confidence
   - Continuous reasoning every 5 minutes

2. **Memory System (Mem0)**
   - Episodic memories: Specific events and outcomes
   - Semantic memories: Learned patterns and strategies
   - Vector database for similarity search
   - Performance tracking and strategy optimization

3. **CDP Integration**
   - CDP SDK v1.24.0 with Ed25519 support
   - Secure wallet management (no private keys)
   - Native Base blockchain interactions
   - Aerodrome protocol operations (swaps, LP, staking, voting)
   - Blockchain RPC reader for direct data access

4. **Data Collectors**
   - Gas Monitor: Tracks gas prices, finds optimal execution windows
   - Pool Scanner: Monitors Aerodrome pools for opportunities

5. **FastAPI Backend**
   - Real-time monitoring endpoints
   - Performance metrics
   - WebSocket for live updates
   - Emergency controls

## 💡 Key Features

### Learning Capabilities
- **Observation Mode**: Learns for 3 days before trading
- Discovers patterns in gas prices
- Identifies profitable pool opportunities
- Learns from successful/failed trades
- Adapts strategies based on market conditions

### Strategies
1. **Liquidity Provision**: Find high-APR pools, manage positions
2. **Arbitrage**: Detect and execute price discrepancies
3. **Yield Farming**: Optimize reward claiming and compounding
4. **Vote Optimization**: Maximize bribes through strategic voting

### Monitoring
- 24/7 operation without manual intervention
- Real-time dashboard via API
- Comprehensive logging with LangSmith
- Performance tracking and analytics

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repo>
cd athena-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API keys to .env

# Run locally
python run.py
```

### Access Points
- API: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- WebSocket: ws://localhost:8000/live

## 📊 API Endpoints

Key endpoints:
- `GET /health` - Agent status
- `GET /performance/{period}` - Profit metrics
- `GET /positions` - Current holdings
- `GET /strategies/active` - Active strategies
- `GET /memories/recent` - Recent learnings
- `GET /gas/recommendation` - Gas analysis
- `GET /pools/opportunities` - Pool opportunities
- `WS /live` - Real-time updates

## 🧠 How Athena Thinks

**Observation Phase (First 3 Days):**
- Collects market data without trading
- Discovers patterns and builds confidence
- Learns optimal timing and market behaviors

**Active Trading Phase:**
1. **Observes**: Collects market data, gas prices, pool states
2. **Remembers**: Retrieves relevant past experiences
3. **Analyzes**: Processes data with historical context
4. **Theorizes**: Forms hypotheses about opportunities
5. **Decides**: Selects best strategies based on confidence
6. **Executes**: Performs on-chain transactions
7. **Learns**: Updates memories with outcomes
8. **Reflects**: Adjusts emotional state and strategies

## 📈 Performance Tracking

Athena tracks:
- Total profit generated
- Win rate by strategy
- Gas optimization savings
- Patterns discovered
- Emotional state (confidence, curiosity, caution)

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **AI/ML**: LangGraph, LangChain, Google Gemini 1.5 Flash
- **Memory**: Mem0 (cloud API or local fallback) + Google Firestore
- **Blockchain**: CDP SDK v1.24.0 for Base chain + RPC Reader
- **Backend**: FastAPI with WebSockets
- **Monitoring**: LangSmith for observability
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Google Cloud Platform

## 🚢 Deployment

### Docker Deployment
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Google Cloud Deployment
```bash
gcloud run deploy athena-ai \
  --source . \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --min-instances 1
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily Operations
- Agent runs autonomously 24/7
- Self-monitors performance
- Adjusts strategies based on market conditions
- Logs all decisions for review

### Human Oversight
- Check profit generation
- Review discovered patterns
- Monitor error logs
- Adjust risk parameters if needed

## 🎓 Learning Examples

Patterns Athena might discover:
- "Gas prices drop 40% between 2-5 AM UTC"
- "New pools have 10x fees in first hour"
- "Bribes spike 60% before epoch changes"
- "AERO/USDC pool most profitable on Tuesdays"

## 🔐 Security

- No private key storage (CDP handles custody)
- All secrets in environment variables
- Transaction simulation before execution
- Risk limits and safety checks
- Emergency shutdown capabilities

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Phase 1**: Core agent with basic strategies ✅
2. **Phase 2**: Advanced learning algorithms (In Progress)
3. **Phase 3**: Multi-protocol support (Planned)
4. **Phase 4**: Decentralized deployment (Future)

## 🤝 Contributing

To extend Athena:
1. Add new strategies in `config/settings.py`
2. Implement strategy logic in agent core
3. Add collectors for new data sources
4. Extend memory schemas for new patterns
